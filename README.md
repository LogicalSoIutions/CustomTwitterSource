# Custom Twitter "Tweeted from" Source

Before running, `settings.json` needs to be configured. 

If you plan on having multiple custom 'sources' I recommend mimicking your Twitter Application Name within `settings.json` and in your `botAccount` variable message to help make it easier for you to remember what source your using.

Be sure to `pip install tweepy` before running

If uploading an image, the image needs to be in the same directory as `tweet.py`
